## What is Programming?

I think it might be helpful to try to define programming as precisely as possible. [Peter Naur](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf) warns us of the dangers of misunderstanding what we are doing when we program:

> If our understanding is inappropriate we will misunderstand the difficulties that arise in the activity and our attempts to overcome them will give rise to conflicts and frustrations. (Peter Naur, Programming as Theory Building)

Programming is hard, but we may releive some of the frustration by properly understanding what we need to focus on. Peter Naur has tried to define programming as "theory building." I find this definition both interesting and helpful in drawing our attention to the most important parts of what we are doing when we program. Naur goes on to make a distinction between the programmer's knowledge, and any artifact that comes out of the task of programming must be considered as secondary to the programmer's knowledge:

> Programming in this sense must be the programmers' building up knowledge of a certain kind, knowledge taken to be basically the programmers' immediate possession, any documentation being an auxiliary, secondary product. (Peter Naur, Programming as Theory Building)

It seems to especially require the programmer to have a long-term investment in the codebase, the larger it is, or the more complex it is:

> The conclusion seems inescapable that at least with certain kinds of large programs, the continued adaptation, modification, and correction of errors in them, is essentially dependent on a certain kind of knowledge possessed by a group of programmers who are closely and continuously connected with them.



As a programmer, you will join a company or an organization, and it is likely that you will not be creating a software application, entirely new, from scratch. There will be existing code. And there will be existing theories about why and how that code implements the given requirements. And hopefully, some of the programmers that first created the application are still working with you, and able to
